Fix UI highlighting:
Currently the editor pane highlight applies to the whole pane, which is wrong.
Change to field-level highlighting: only the focused editor field gets a colored border.
Use BLUE for NAV mode and RED for EDIT mode.
Implement with per-field wrapper QFrames and a central update function triggered by focusChanged and mode changes.
Do not change domain logic. Output only modified UI files.
